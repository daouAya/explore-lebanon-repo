Don't push to main directly 
create a branch from master(where master should be equal to main only Aya merges to main) and push to ur created branch
(example of branch naming convention: Aya-1 commit description should contain Aya-1-what aya did i this commit) 
you push to ur branch than from ur branch you merge to master when you are all done with ur changes we merge from master to main
